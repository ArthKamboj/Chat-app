# Chat-app (WebSocket Implementation)

A simple real-time chat application built using **Spring Boot**, **WebSockets**, and static frontend assets.

---

## Description

This project is a minimal WebSocket-based chat application built with the Spring Boot framework. It allows users to join a chat room and exchange messages in real time. The frontend is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it communicates with the backend through a WebSocket connection.

Key aspects of the project:

- **WebSocket Communication**: Clients connect via WebSockets to receive and send messages instantly.
- **Spring Boot Backend**: Handles WebSocket sessions, message broadcasting, and user connection/disconnection events.
- **Lightweight Frontend**: No frontend frameworks used â€” just vanilla JS and HTML/CSS.
- **Dockerized**: Easily containerized for deployment with a simple Dockerfile.
- **Deployable to Cloud**: Optimized for platforms like **Render** or **AWS**.

This is a great starting point for building real-time applications like group chats, dashboards, notifications, or collaborative tools.
